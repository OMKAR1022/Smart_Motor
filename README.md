Smart Water Pump Control System

This project enables remote control of water pump motors using an ESP8266 NodeMCU, MQTT protocol, and a relay module. The system utilizes HiveMQ's public MQTT broker for secure and reliable communication.

Key Features:
Remote Control: Operate water pumps from anywhere using MQTT commands.

Web-Based Control: Integrate with a Flutter application for real-time control.

Safety: Uses a relay module to handle high-voltage water pump motors safely.

Secure Communication: Future support for SSL/TLS to enhance data security.

Components:
*) ESP8266 NodeMCU: Microcontroller for WiFi and MQTT communication. 
*) Relay Module: Controls high-voltage water pump motors.
*) HiveMQ Broker: Public MQTT broker for message routing.
Setup:
Hardware: Connect the NodeMCU to a relay module and water pump.
Software: Use the provided code to configure the NodeMCU and control the relay via MQTT.
Flutter App: Interact with the system remotely through a mobile application.
